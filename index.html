        While this quarter of school was very different from past quarters and a bit chaotic at times, I believe that despite the tough situation I had a truly remarkable learning experience with this class. One of my biggest takeaways was the combination of academic research and our creativity to argue for an apocalyptic end. In the past, I believed that a research paper was solely based on facts and simply conveying and presenting those facts to the audience. On the other hand, I believed creative writing was entirely based on one’s imagination to compose a fictional story. Through this assignment, I got to experience that writing is not definitive or absolute, but different types and aspects of writing can be combined. In particular, the aspects of research and creative writing  were combined by gathering facts and information through research and then creating a speculative creative version of an apocalypse and using rhetorical devices to argue that stance. Overall, I think this course really allowed me to solidify my argumentative abilities along with developing my storytelling, research, and combining those two together.

            One of the most meaningful texts from this class would be the poem “Try to praise the mutilated world” by Adam Zagajewski.This poem essentially offers a contrast between what the world was like before and the world after a catastrophe struck. This poem seems to emphasize that we ought to try and appreciate and discover the beauty among the tragic and chaotic times. Especially during these times, art has a powerful ability to ignite our imagination of the joyful times and memories of the past which has a healing and soothing effect. This was a very meaningful poem to me because especially during the pandemic I found myself beginning to appreciate art ,especially music, and its power to transport my mind to simpler times which allowed me to relax.

            One piece of text I found very interesting was the piece “On cussing” by Dunn. In this text Dunn essentially describes cussing as an artform of rhetoric. She argues that cussing is a necessary part of expression and that no other word choice can truly encapsulate our strong emotions better than the use of cuss words. While Dunn believes that cussing should be incorporated for expression, she does not believe in its overuse due to the word losing its power. I found this text very interesting because I found the use of cuss words in writing and just in regular speech to be vulgar and a bit offensive. However, with this text it really brought upon a new perspective and changed my view on cussing.

          Overall, this class was a fascniating class and I had an amazing time this quarter learning about concepts such as apocalypse, dystopia, utopia and many more. I believe that this class was especially engaging and interesting due to its relevance in today's society and the events going on throughout the world. Lastly, I would like to thank my TA and professor Gumm for making this such an enjoyable class.
